### BETA RELEASE

## A CLI for creating Discord.js bots with ease.

# Installation:

NOTE: You'll need to install the CLI globally in order for it to work. You may need to install with sudo as well.

```
sudo npm i -g @discordjs-cli/discordjs-cli
```

## Commands:

If you've worked with the Angular CLI before, this will look familiar :)

To generate a new Discord.js bot, run the `djs new <project-name>` command. This will create a Discord bot template for you to work off of.
